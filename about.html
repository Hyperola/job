                    <p>With over 12 years of experience in human resources and talent acquisition across West Africa, I founded SwiftBliss Jobs to solve a critical challenge I witnessed daily: the disconnect between exceptional talent and meaningful opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our platform represents more than just job listings - it's a commitment to building a fair, transparent, and efficient job market where qualifications speak louder than connections, and opportunities are accessible to all.</p>
